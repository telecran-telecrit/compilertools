generating software from specifications</A>.
They are applicable to a
range of problems that is much broader than the development of compilers
for programming languages: Processors for input languages, design
languages, specification languages, and intermediate languages in
applications programs all demand solutions to translation problems.</P>
<P>We have combined a variety of standard tools that implement powerful
compiler construction strategies into a domain-specific programming
environment called <DFN>Eli</DFN>.  Using this environment, one can
automatically generate complete language implementations from
application-oriented specifications.  The implementations might be
interpretive, using the constructs of the source language to invoke
operations of an existing system, or might involve translation into an
arbitrary target language.</P>
<P>Eli provides modern compiler construction facilities to users with a
wide range of sophistication. It offers complete solutions for
commonly-encountered language implementation subtasks and contains
libraries of reusable specifications, making possible the production of
high-quality implementations from simple problem descriptions.</P>
<P>The system has been in the field since 1989, and has been used in a
number of projects worldwide.  It generates programs whose performance
is comparable to that of a good hand-coded implementation.  Development
time for a processor using Eli is generally about one third of that for
comparable hand code, and maintenance is significantly easier because
specifications rather than implementations are being maintained.</P>
<H1>Application Areas</H1>
<P>Eli has been and is being used successfully in a number of areas to
produce translators, program generators, analysers and interpreters. 
Here is a small selection of applications we have heard about:</P>
<H2>Programming language compilers for</H2>
<UL>
<LI>ANSI C to SPARC machine code</LI>
<LI>Pascal to Pcode</LI>
<LI>Pascal to C</LI>
<LI>Many user-defined languages</LI></UL>
<H2>Special processors that translate</H2>
<UL><LI>Musical notation to PostScript scores</LI>
<LI>Statistical data to TeX tables or histograms</LI></UL>
<H2>Program generators that produce</H2>
<UL><LI>C simulation programs from descriptions of mechanical
systems</LI>
<LI>Query language calls from a database description</LI>
<LI>Finite-element models from descriptions of solids</LI></UL>
<H2>Interpreters that</H2>
<UL><LI>Do animation from descriptions of graphics</LI>
<LI>Interactively evaluate decision tables</LI></UL>
<H2>Analyzers to</H2>
<UL><LI>Enforce programming style</LI>
<LI>Interactively validate commands for satellite control</LI>
<LI>Compute and present statistics</LI></UL>
<H1>Advantages of Eli</H1>
<P>Eli is a freely-available system that has
many advantages over conventional tool sets for compiler
construction.</P>
<H2>Problem-oriented instead of tool-oriented:</H2>
<P>The user describes the problem that must be solved.  Eli
automatically  employs the tools and components needed for that
particular problem.  Because of this, it is possible to improve tools
and components without invalidating specifications.</P>
<H2>Broad spectrum of tasks and solutions:</H2>
<P>Eli offers solutions for most of the tasks that must be carried out
to implement a language.  They range from structural analysis (solved by
tools analogous to LEX and YACC) through analysis of names, types and
values, to  storage of translation data structures and production of the
target text.  There is even a declarative specification for the
command-line parameterization of the generated programs.</P>
<H2>Little prior knowledge required:</H2>
<P>A basic understanding of languages and language structures suffices
to begin using Eli.  Tutorials with sample problems and solutions,
together with extensive on-line documentation and an interactive help
system lead the user further if they so desire.</P>
<H2>Integrated system, with flexible overriding:</H2>
<P>All components of Eli are coordinated with one another in such a way
that the interfaces of the generated modules fit together.  As a result,
Eli generates a complete set of C modules, including a Makefile, to
solve the specified problem.  Mechanisms are provided to allow users to
override standard modules and interfaces if necessary to solve specific
problems.</P>
<H2>State-of-the art components:</H2>
<P>Eli's tools and modules are implemented according to current
understanding of the best approaches to solving translation problems. 
The generated programs are reliable and efficient.  Eli is widely used
and tested.</P>
<H2>Selective regeneration:</H2>
<P>In the course of developing a language implementation, the user
makes many changes and corrections in the specification.  Eli guarantees
that the product is always generated from the current
specification and that only the generation steps that are actually
required are carried out.</P>
