<h2>
What's New</h2>

<ul>
<li>
January, 2003: Bug fixed in SWI port of ALE 3.2.1 - compilation of grammar
source would fail in some circumstances.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
December, 2001: <a href="ale.html#Obtain">ALE 3.2.1 is available</a>.&nbsp; This
version patches ALE and its source-level debugger so that they work with
SICStus 3.8.6 and SWI 4.0.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
June, 1999: <a href="ale.html#Obtain">ALE 3.2 is available</a>. In this version:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>ALE is faster (again)</b>, both at compile-time and run-time,</li>

<li>
<b>A new parsing compilation algorithm (Empty-First-Daughter closure)</b>,
which:</li>

<ul>
<li>
corrects a long-standing problem in ALE with combining empty categories
- EFD closure closes the phrase structure rules of a grammar under prefixes
of empty category daughters, so any permutation of empty categories can,
in principle, be combined to form a new empty category;</li>

<li>
works around a problem that non-ISO-compatible Prologs, including SICStus
Prolog, have with asserted predicates that results in leftmost empty category
daughters not being able to combine with their own outputs;</li>

<li>
allows parsers to establish a precondition that rules only need to be closed
with non-empty leftmost daughters at run-time - this allows ALE, at each
step in its right-to-left pass throught the string, to copy all of the
edges in the internal database back onto the heap before they can be used
again, and thus reduces edge copying to a constant 2 copies per edge for
non-empty edges (edges with different left and right nodes). Keeping a
copy of the chart on the heap also allows for more sophisticated indexing
strategies that would otherwise be overwhelmed by the cost of copying the
edge before matching. This puts to rest the misconception that Prolog-based
parsers are necessarily inefficient because of copying overhead.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Shallow cuts (if-then-else predicates)</b> have been added to the definite
clause language</li>

<li>
<b>Faster extensionalisation code</b>, particularly with grammars that
have few or no extensional types,</li>

<li>
<b>Faster subsumption checking code</b> for chart edges,</li>

<li>
<b>ALE Source-level Debugger 3.0,</b> which has been integrated with the
new SICStus 3.7 source-level debugger,</li>

<li>
More compile-time error and warning messages,</li>

<li>
Several bug corrections,</li>

<li>
An updated user's manual,</li>

<li>
An SWI Prolog port.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
September, 1998: <a href="ale.html#Obtain">ALE 3.1 is available</a>. In this version:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>ALE is now substantially faster</b>. Extensively revised code, making
better use of shallow cuts, first-argument indexing, and other tricks of
the Prolog trade,</li>

<li>
<b>A new, faster, term-expansion-based compiler</b>. ALE now uses only
one zero-byte intermediate file to compile its intermediate code. Intermediate
code is saved for future use by saving the Prolog database itself,</li>

<li>
<b>ALE Source-level Debugger 2.0</b>, which now supports semantic-head-driven
generation,</li>

<li>
<b>Lexicon compile/consult options</b> (lex_compile/0, lex_consult/0).
Consulting the lexicon substantially reduces compilation time, with negligible
consequences at run-time for most grammars,</li>

<li>
<b>New commands to modify the lexicon incrementally </b>(update_lex/1,
retract_lex/1). Also export_words/2, to write the words of a lexicon to
a stream,</li>

<li>
<b>New parsing commands</b> to filter solutions through a description and
for batch parsing (rec/2,5, rec_best/2, rec_list/2,3),</li>

<li>
<b>Prolog character escapes</b> can be used in conjunction with ALE,</li>

<li>
Several bug corrections,</li>

<li>
An updated user's manual,</li>

<li>
An updated SWI Prolog port.</li>

<h2>
<a NAME="AleOverview"></a>Overview</h2>
ALE 3.2, a freeware system written in Prolog by <a href="http://216.25.95.35/carp/index.html">Bob
Carpenter</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn">Gerald Penn</a>
integrates phrase structure parsing, semantic-head-driven generation and
constraint logic programming with typed feature structures as terms. This
generalizes both the feature structures of PATR-II and the terms of Prolog
II to allow type inheritance and appropriateness specifications for features
and values. Arbitrary constraints may be attached to types, and types may
be declared as having extensional structural identity conditions. Grammars
may also interleave unification steps with logic program goal calls (as
can be done in DCGs), thus allowing parsing to be interleaved with other
system components. ALE was developed with an eye toward <a href="http://ling.ohio-state.edu/HPSG/Hpsg.html">Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar</a> (HPSG), but it can also execute PATR-II grammars,
definite clause grammars (DCGs), Prolog, Prolog-II, and LOGIN programs,
etc. With suitable coding, it can also execute several aspects of <a href="http://clwww.essex.ac.uk/LFG/">Lexical-Functional
Grammar</a> (LFG).
<p>The terms involved in ALE grammars and logic programs are specified
using a typed extension of Rounds-Kasper attribute-value logic, which includes
variables, full disjunction, inequations, and functional descriptions.
Programs are then compiled into low-level Prolog instructions corresponding
to the basic operations of the typed Rounds-Kapser logic. There is a strong
type discipline enforced on descriptions, allowing many errors to be detected
at compile-time.
<p>The logic programming, parsing, and generating systems may be used independently
or together. Features of the logic programming system include negation,
disjunction and cuts. It has last call optimization, but does not perform
any argument indexing.
<p>The phrase structure system employs a bottom-up, all-paths dynamic chart
parser. A general lexical rule component is provided, including procedural
attachment and general methods for orthographic transformations using pattern
matching or Prolog. Empty categories are permitted in the grammar. A mini-interpreter
is included for stepping through the parsing process. Both the phrase structure
and logic programming components of the system allow parametric macros
to be defined and freely employed in descriptions. The language allows
hooks to general Prolog routines, allowing the grammars and programs to
be embedded in Prolog, and thus also in C and Unix. Parser performance
is similar to that of the logic programming system.
<p>The generation component also uses the phrase structure system plus
a user-defined semantics definite clause that identifies semantically relevant
information in feature structures. It uses an adaptation of the algorithm
presented in:
<p><a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber">Shieber, S.</a>, <a href="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~vannoord">van
Noord, G.</a>, Moore, R., and <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~pereira">Pereira,
F.</a> (1990). <a href="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/papers/cl90.ps.gz">Semantic-head-driven
Generation</a>.
<i><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&tid=10">Computational
Linguistics</a></i>, 16.
<p>This algorithm is very well suited to large-scale HPSG generation, since
it avoids the non-termination problems inherent to top-down processing
of lexicocentric theories, but at the same time, does not require the semantic
contribution of every daughter in a grammar rule to subsume some portion
of the semantic contribution of the mother, as, for example, is the case
with Earley-based strategies. Some example glue code is provided to show
how to attach two SICStus Prolog processes, one running a parser and one
running a generator, to build a simple machine translation with ALE.
<p>The source-level debugger can be used to trace nearly every operation
in ALE's built-in parser, generator and definite clause resolver down to
the level of feature structure unification. Based upon the procedural box
model of control flow, it supports breakpoints, skipping, and leashing,
and is compatible with ALE's built-in chart interpreter for navigating
a parsing chart, as well as SICStus Prolog's own source-level debugger
for on-line debugging of Prolog hooks. When used with its XEmacs interface,
the buffer will indicate the current line being processed during execution.
In a future release, the ALE source-level debugger will be extended to
operations below the level of feature structure unification.
<h2>
<a NAME="AleDoc"></a>Documentation</h2>
Complete documentation for ALE 3.2.x (running to over 130 pages, with examples
of everything, programming advice, and sample grammars) is available in
postscript and LaTeX format in the <a href="ale.html#Obtain">general ALE release</a>.
<p>This document is also available in HTML format by clicking:
<ul>ALE 3.2 User's Guide, HTML Version (coming soon!)</ul>
ALE is based on the typed attribute-value logic and associated grammar
and constraint logic programming model developed in:
<ul><a href="http://216.25.95.35/carp/index.html">Bob Carpenter</a> (1992)
<i><a href="http://uk.cambridge.org/computerscience/theoretical/catalogue/0521419328/">The
Logic of Typed Feature Structures</a></i>. Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical
Computer Science 32. <a href="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University
Press</a>.</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="SysReq"></a>System Requirements</h2>
ALE was developed with SICStus Prolog 3.8.6, but only requires that if
the source-level debugger is used. For cyclic feature structures, at least
version 2.1#8 is required. ALE itself is rather compact and takes up about
300K when compiled. The size of grammar that can be compiled and string
that can be parsed will be determined by the size and structure of the
grammar itself.
<p>The efficiency of the system depends on first-argument indexing, last-call
optimization, and for the chart parser, the indexing of dynamic clauses.
The system will be very slow if it is interpreted rather than compiled.
<p>The ALE source-level debugger requires SICStus Prolog 3.8.6. Its XEmacs
interface requires XEmacs 20.3 or higher.
<p>The SWI port of ALE can be run on SWI Prolog 4.0 or higher.
<p>The Quinuts port of ALE 3.0 was the last port of ALE made to Quintus
Prolog. Its behaviour with cyclic feature structures is unpredictable;
and there are some hard restrictions on the number of variables in compiled
clauses that can make the development of grammars with large descriptions
in rules, lexical rules or the lexicon very difficult.

<a NAME="Interface"></a>Third-Party User Interfaces</h2>

<h3>
HDrug</h3>
The HDrug system, developed by <a href="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~vannoord">Gertjan
van Noord</a>, is a package for developing logic grammars implemented on
top of SICStus Prolog 3.0 or later, and Tcl/Tk. It has been tested on HP-UX,
Linux and Sun platforms. Information is available for it on the:
<dl><a href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/Hdrug/">HDrug Homepage</a></dl>
HDrug has extensive features for performance evaluation, including plotting
of statistical information. It contains methods for viewing parses as they
are created, modifying them, and comparing them with other parses. It also
contains an on-line manual.
<p>The HDrug release includes a number of utilities for grammar formalisms
other than ALE, including tree adjoining grammar, definite clause grammars,
categorial grammar, head-driven generation grammar, and extraposition grammars.
Also interesting is Gertjan's joint work with <a href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~gosse/">Gosse
Bouma</a> on delayed evaluation for lexical rules in the context of an
HPSG grammar for Dutch.
