<P>
<I>Last Revised 2017/01/09</I>
</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Archelon Inc. has, since 1982, developed tools for microcoding and 
consulted to major companies in the area of micro-architecture design. 
In particular, we have pioneered the implementation of standard high 
level languages on microprogrammed hardware, signal processor chips 
and other unique architectures.
</P>
<P>
Our mission is to streamline the process of writing software for new 
chips for companies concerned about software quality, speed of 
development or their competitive position in adopting new hardware 
technology quickly and affordably.
</P>
<P>
Our new user retargetable software development system makes it 
possible to have a high level language compiler and a full set of 
software development tools running for any programmable architecture 
in a matter of weeks. The compiler supports the full ANSI standard for 
C plus a number of extensions which are particularly useful for 
microprogrammed architectures and for architectures which contain 
application-specific hardware.
</P>
<P>
The current Retargetable Tools suite
has been in active use since 1990 and is being continuously enhanced
to support new ideas in computer architecture design.
</P>

<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
The complete set of components included in the system include the 
following:

<P>
These tools allow you to write code for your machine at three 
different levels:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>
		At the high level language level, you can write standard C code.
	</LI> 
	<LI>
		At the "compactor level", you can design your own instruction set 
		and assembly language encoding.
	</LI>
	<LI>
		At the microcode assembler level, you can deal with complex 
		instruction formats by dealing with each machine instruction in terms 
		of its component fields.
	</LI> 
</UL>

<P>
This new version of the retargetable development tools 
dramatically increases the capabilities of the compiler to generate 
code customized for your hardware.
</P>

<H3>How Retargeting Works - General Overview</H3>
<P>
There are two text files that you write to instruct the compiler and 
the "compactor" about your hardware. The first is the
<A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#cif">Compiler Information File</A> (CIF), which
is used by the compiler (as its name suggests).  The second is the 
Machine Definition File (MDF) which the compactor uses to translate the 
compiler output into microcode specifically for your machine.
These files are read by our software every time the program 
which requires them runs, so there is no need to reccompile 
which you change one of these control files.
</P>
<P>
These files have a number of features to make it easier for 
you to adapt the compiler and assembler to your system and you can 
conveniently build up your system, incrementally, doing one operation 
at a time. The implementation of a complete instruction set typically 
involves writing 1,000 to 3,000 lines for each of the two files, and 
you can do it all without having to understand compilers -- all you 
need to understand is your hardware. We're just a phone call away if 
you ever require a word of guidance.
</P>
<P>
When you study the <A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html">code samples</A>
we have provided,
notice how the CIF allows you to describe the operation codes and 
instruction formats.
Review the <A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#codetables">Code Table</A> section
to see how you can instruct the compiler to generate different results 
based on different operands.  This, and other features, give you a lot 
of flexibility in getting the code output that you want.
</P>
<P>
The following Technical Overview goes into some detail. If 
you prefer a quicker scan of our system, turn to the sections on the 
individual components such as the <A HREF="retarg.html#mcc">C Compiler</A>
and the <A HREF="retarg.html#mcpack">Compactor</A>.
We hope that you will see how your software development can be built 
reliably with high-level tools - for greater productivity and maybe 
even a little more peace of mind.
</P>           

<H3><A NAME="cif">Technical Overview</A></H3>
<P>
The compiler generates instructions using code tables which 
you provide in a text file, called the Compiler Information File 
(CIF). This file describes the instructions of your machine and tells 
the compiler how to generate code for it. The information in the file 
includes descriptions of:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>
		the <A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#registers">registers</A> of the machine
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#operands">operand types</A>
		(constants, registers, and address modes)
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#formats">instruction formats</A>
		(which you describe using operand types)
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#opcodes">instruction opcodes</A>
		(which you describe using instruction formats)
	</LI>
	<LI>
		<A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#codetables">code tables</A>
	</LI>
	<LI>
		the mapping of intermediate language operations to code tables
	</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The code generation scheme supports the widest possible 
variety of hardware architectures, even those which are very 
irregular. It can handle single-address, two-address or three-address 
instructions.
</P>
<P>
The code generation method starts with a node of an 
expression tree. Using the operator (such as "add") and the 
type (such as "int"), it selects a code table. In each code 
table, there may be a series of predicate expressions. Associated with 
each predicate is an instruction sequence. The predicate expressions 
allow you to test to see the node and its operands meet certain 
conditions. For instance, you can test to see if an operand is a 
constant that lies within some range which is legal for an immediate 
operand of an instruction. The compiler evaluates each predicate in 
turn until either it reaches one which matches or it finds a default 
case. This process determines which instruction sequence to 
use.
</P>
<P>
An instruction sequence is a set of instructions, each of 
which may have one or more labels associated with it. An instruction 
consists of an opcode and arguments. The CIF definition language 
provides syntax which allows you to define an opcode as the 
concatenation of arguments passed in from a higher level with literal 
strings. This allows you to handle situations where you need to 
generate a slightly different opcode if an operand is an immediate 
value.
</P>
<P>
The result of evaluating an opcode in an instruction 
sequence must be an operation code defined in the CIF file. By looking 
at the instruction format defined for that operation code and the 
allowable operand types associated with that format, the compiler can 
evaluate the arguments to each instruction into operands which are 
legal for that instruction. For instance, if the argument is the left 
hand side tree of the intermediate language operation and the only 
allowable operand type is a general purpose register, then the 
compiler will generate code to evaluate the left hand side tree into a 
general purpose register. It will then use that register as an operand 
of the generated instruction.
</P>
<P>
An <A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#operands">operand</A> can be a constant range, a register set, an 
address mode, or any combination thereof. There is a fairly general 
scheme for describing address modes, based on the model:
</P>
<CENTER>register + constant + ( register * scale_factor )</CENTER>
<P>
where all but either the register_base or the offset are  optional.     
</P>
<P>
Since operands can be held in register pairs, if 
needed, we provide syntax which allows you to refer to one or the 
other of the registers in the pair. This is handy for cases such as 
where you need to implement a 32 bit add of two register pairs by 
doing a 16 bit add on the least significant part of the register pairs 
followed by an add with carry of the most significant parts.
</P>
<P>
When you describe <A HREF="http://www.archelon.com/code_samples.html#registers">registers</A>
in the CIF file, you can 
specify what data types the compiler can put in the registers. You can 
also restrict how the compiler can use the register in an instruction. 
The possibilities are that you can use the register as the left 
operand of an instruction, as the right operand of an instruction, as 
the result of an instruction, as the target of a load from memory, as 
the source of a store to memory, or some combination of these 
properties.
</P>
<P>
To support efficient implementation of structure 
assignments, the compiler allows you to access structure size 
information in predicate tests and instruction sequences.
</P>
<P>
To fully implement a CIF file for your machine, you 
will have to write one or two thousand lines of code. However, you do 
not have to implement everything all at once before you can start 
generating code.
</P>
<P>
The instructions produced by the compiler are 
called VOPs (Vertical OPerations).
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="mdf">The next part</A>
of retargeting is in converting the 
instructions output by the compiler into final assembly
code. In some machines, this may be compacted horizontal 
microcode. This is done by the program <A HREF="retarg.html#mcpack">MCPACK</A>.
It uses a control file, 
called the Machine Definition File (MDF), which defines the fields of 
the instruction word, the resources which are available to be used, 
and procedures which translate each compiler-emitted VOPs into 
sequences of Micro-Operations (MOPs). The language used in the MDF 
allows you wide latitude to get better code for special cases during 
this translation.
</P>
<P>
If your machine is not a micro-programmed design, you can 
think of the MDF file as a program which tells the MCPACK program how 
to translate assembler syntax of your design into actual instruction 
encodings, which can then be assembled into object code by the MCASR 
assembler.
</P>
<P>
For microcoded machines, and other machines which allow 
parallelism in the instruction word, MCPACK does instruction 
scheduling and
compaction. Using the resource information programmed into each MOP, 
MCPACK compacts straight line sequences of MOPs into horizontal 
Microcode Instructions (MIs) which are output into an ASCII file, 
ready for assembly by the <A HREF="retarg.html#mcasr">MCASR</A> relocatable assembler.
</P>
<P>
The size of the MDF depends largely on your architecture. 
For an implementation of a complete instruction set, we would expect 
to see an MDF file of between 1,000 and 3,000 lines in length. Of 
course, you would not have to sit down and write out 3,000 lines of 
code before using the system. The writing will usually be done 
incrementally, starting with definitions of fields, field values, and 
locations, then defining the opcode translations in groups. For 
instance, you might do load/store operations first, then integer 
add/subtract/and/or/exclusive-or, then branches, then integer shifts, 
then integer multiply/divide/remainder, and so on.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="mcpp">The Macro Preprocessor - MCPP</A></H3>

<P>
MCPP implements all the features defined for 
the C preprocessor in the ANSI Standard for the programming language C 
(ANSI C) so that it can be used to preprocess input to the C compiler.
</P>
<P> 
Some extra directives have been added to support writing macros for 
<A HREF="retarg.html#mcpack">MCPACK</A> or <A HREF="retarg.html#mcasr">MCASR</A>.
</P>
<P>
Although the preprocessor allows macros defined using 
#define to be carried over more than one line, the expansion of such a 
macro does not contain any newline characters. MCPP allows macros 
which expand as several lines using the directives
</P>
<PRE WIDTH=70>
   #macro <i>name</i> (<I>arg1</I>, <I>arg2</I>, ... <I>argn</I> )
   ...
   #mend
</PRE>
<P>         
To support repetition, MCPP allows nested repeat blocks of 
the form
</P>
<PRE WIDTH=60>
   #rept <i>expr</i>
   ...
   #endr
</PRE>
<P>         
Finally, MCPP provides a way to define symbolic constants 
which can be redefined within MCPP. You do this using
</P>
<PRE WIDTH=60>
   #set <i>name expr</i>
</PRE>
<P>         
This directive is useful for controlling the expansion of 
repeats and for changing values used inside repeats.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="mcc">Optimizing C Compiler - MCC</A></H3>

<P>
MCC supports the full language, as defined by ANSI C
(ANSI/ISO 9899-1990), plus 
some extensions which are discussed below.
</P>
<P>
The input to the compiler is, of course, your C program. The 
output is a file of "Vertical Operations" (or VOPs), which can 
be fed into the <A HREF="retarg.html#mcpeep">Peephole Optimizer</A> or directly to the 
<A HREF="retarg.html#mcpack">Compactor</A>.
</P>
<p>
In the simplest case, the VOPs are just assembly language instructions.
However, if you machine has parallelism in its instruction word,
then the VOPs can be partial instructions, which can be compacted and
assembled into complete instructions by the Compactor. 
</p>
<P>
The basic Compiler optimizations include constant folding, global 
common subexpression elimination in extended conditional regions and 
allocation of registers by graph coloring.
</P>
<p>
If you turn on the compiler's advanced machine independent optimizer,
the compiler will also do all of the optimizations which can be derived from
doing global flow analysis on a function, including
<ul>
<li>
global common sub-expression elimination,
<li>
constant propagation,
<li>
dead code elimination,
<li>
reduction in strength,
and
<li>
loop induction variable elimination, and
<li>
aliasing analysis
</ul>
</p>
<P>
The extensions to the ANSI C standard which the compiler 
supports are:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>multi-media types</B><BR>
		You can define new, machine-dependent types which you can use
		to provide support for vector parallel or
		single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) parallel
		data types, such as are commonly found in multimedia 
		computer architectures.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>fixed point data types</B><BR>
		The compiler allows you to declare signed fixed point data types,
		using the non-standard "_frac" keyword.
		This keyword can be applied to any integral type.
		It also supports
		fixed point constants - in the form of a floating point
		number in the range from -1.0 to 1.0, suffixed by ``r'' or ``R''.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>"long long" type</B><BR>
		The compiler has support for a "long long" type, which is
		in the next draft of the ANSI standard. This is
		mainly useful for dealing with accumulator registers in
		Digital Signal Processing (DSP) architectures.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>global register variables</B><BR>
		Global registers never need to be saved or 
		restored.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>fast switch</B><BR>
		This is similar to a regular switch statement except 
		that no bounds checking is done on the switch value. This can 
		save 4 or 5 microinstructions if speed is critical.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>inline functions</B><BR>
		You can use the __inline__ keyword on a 
		functiondeclaration to specify that the function be expanded 
		inline at the point of each call, saving the overhead of calling and 
		returning.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>hardware loop counter control</B><BR>
		If the hardware system's sequencer has a loop 
		counter, the compiler allows direct control of it through the 
		loop statement. The compiler will also permit nested loop
		statements if the hardware supports them.
	</LI>
	<LI><B> builtin functions</B><BR>
		The compiler provides a way for you to provide 
		completely custom code table entries which you can access 
		directly by calling a function whose name is the same as that 
		of the code table entry. Such a function can have zero, one or 
		two arguments. This lets you special instructions or sequences 
		of instructions which can not reasonably be written in C, 
		while retaining the look and convenience of high level code.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>in line assembler code</B><BR>
		If builtin functions are not enough, you can embed 
		assembler code inside C functions. Embedded assembler code can 
		include symbolic references to variables or structure members 
		declared in your C source code. The compiler replaces each 
		symbolic reference by an address, an offset or a register number, 
		depending on what is being referenced.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>user specified register binding</B><BR>
		Special syntax for register variable declarations 
		allows you to bind a specific registerto a variable rather 
		than letting the compiler choose an arbitrary register.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>argument registers</B><BR>
		To speed up function calls, you designate registers 
		which the compiler will use forpassing arguments to 
		functions.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>multiple address spaces</B><BR>
		The compiler supports three different memory 
		configurations. You can have both codeand data in one address 
		space, you can have code in one address space and data in 
		another, or you can have code in one address space, part of your data 
		in a primary data address space, and part of your data in  
		one, two. or three additional
		data address spaces. To use additional data address spaces, 
		you must declare variables in and pointers to those memories 
		using the non-standard keywords _DMEM2, _DMEM3, or _DMEM4.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>symbolic debug tables</B><BR>
		The compiler can optionally generate symbolic debug 
		tables in so-called <I>Common Object File Format</I> (COFF).
		This comes in two flavours: Standard Coff or Archelon Coff.
		Archelon COFF has extensions which support the definition
		and referencing of data in multiple overlapping address spaces,
		and which supports additional type codes for fixed point types.
	</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="mcpeep">The Peephole Optimizer - MCPEEP</A></H3>

<P>
The sequence of VOPs generated by the 
compiler may optionally be processed by a peephole optimizer, MCPEEP, 
before being passed to MCPACK. MCPEEP replaces sequences of VOPs with 
more efficient sequences. The user specifies the sequences which can 
be replaced and what they are to be replaced by in a file called the 
replacement rules file (RLS).
</P>


<H3><A NAME="mcpack">The Optimizer/Scheduler/Compactor - MCPACK</A></H3>

<P>
The input to MCPACK is a file containing 
Vertical Operations (VOPs). The output is a file containing 
micro-instructions ready to be assembled by <A HREF="retarg.html#mcasr">MCASR</A>.
Under the control 
of a file, called the Machine Definition File (MDF), MCPACK reads 
VOPs, expands them into sequences of Micro-Operations (MOPs) and 
compacts the MOPs into a (usually) smaller number of 
Micro-Instructions (MIs).
</P>
<P>
You can use MCPACK to implement the instructions generated 
by the compilers or to implement an arbitrary byte- or word-oriented 
assembly language.
</P>
<P>
The MDF contains statements in a language designed 
specifically for compaction. A typical MDF file includes the 
following:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>field name definitions and field value mnemonics</LI>
	<LI>field location specifications</LI>
	<LI>microword width specification</LI>
	<LI>consumable resource definitions</LI>
	<LI>VOP definitions</LI>
	<LI>Function definitions</LI>
	<LI>MOP definitions</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The VOP, Function, and MOP definitions are written as 
procedures in a string-oriented language which has some similarities 
with the C language. Each is translated into an intermediate form and 
interpreted by MCPACK when it is invoked. The language includes 
facilities for defining and preserving timing relationships between 
MOPs. A timing delay can be either required or optional. You can use 
timing delays to implement pipelined operations.
</P>
<P>
MCPACK can optionally take the MDF information and use it to 
generate a definitions file in the format required by 
MCASR.
</P>
<P>
The compiler generates a specific set of VOPs. To support 
the compiler, you must define the set of VOPs which it will generate 
when compiling code.
</P>
<P>
If you do not wish to support the retargetable compilers, 
you can define any set of VOPs which seem appropriate to your needs. 
In effect, you can design your own assembler-level language. You can 
then write low level code as VOPs and leave the job of generating and 
compacting the corresponding MOP sequences to MCPACK.
</P>
<P>
Normally, MCPACK will do all of the work of lexical analysis of
the input in order to identify VOPs and their operands.
However, MCPACK also lets you support pretty much any style of
input syntax by allowing you to provide a function in the MDF
file which handles some or all of the parsing of the input.
To that end, MCPACK also provides some builtin functions
which will allow you to tokenize and/or to scan the input lines.
</P>
<P>
MCPACK makes it easy to define and handle opcodes with comma-separated
operands. However, if you want to support a more elaborate syntax
(such as one which looks more like a higher level language),
MCPACK has support for doing recursive descent parsing. It lets
break up each input line into a string of tokens which be parsed
using rules which you implement by writing code.
</P>
<P>
If you need to record information about symbols (such as labels
or data declarations), MCPACK provides a symbol table manager
which allows to define symbols and to associate with each symbol
one or more attributes, each of which can have a unique value.
</P>
<P>
You can also use MCPACK to do instruction scheduling
(reordering of instructions to reduce or elminate pipeline delays)
and/or compaction (to take advantage of any parallelism in
the instruction set).
</P>

<H3><A NAME="mcasr">The Assembler - MCASR</A></H3>

<P>
MCASR is a fast, "bit-stuffing" macro assembler 
which can be customized to suit any micro-architecture and any 
microinstruction length. Customization is done by creating a text file 
in a standard format which describes microinstruction length and the 
mnemonics to be used. MCASR produces a relocatable object file ready 
to be linked by the MCLINK linker.
</P>
<P>
If you are also using MCPACK, then you do not have to write 
a definitions file for MCASR, since MCPACK can generate it for 
you.
</P>
<P>
In the mnemonic definitions file, you associate a name with 
a specific pattern of bits to be placed in the micro-instruction. Each 
mnemonic sets up one or more field values. A field value is a triple 
consisting of a constant value (which determines the contents of the 
field), a mask (which determines the width of the field) and a shift 
count (which determines the position of the field in the 
micro-instruction). You may optionally provide field values at 
assembly time. Any field may contain a relocatable expression. There 
is also provision for handling fields with vertical instruction coding 
and for handling fields which occur more than once in the 
microword.
</P>
<P>
Default field values can be specified either in the 
definitions file or in a .default statement in the assembler 
source.
</P>
<P>
In writing a micro-assembler program, each line of input 
containing one or more mnemonics corresponds to one micro-instruction 
word. The assembler detects any attempt to reuse or overlap fields in 
a micro-instruction. It takes its input in free format and in any 
order with one instruction per line (there is provision for 
continuation).
</P>
<P>
The output of MCASR is a relocatable object module in a 
format acceptable to <A HREF="retarg.html#mclink">MCLINK</A>.
MCASR also supports the following 
directives or "pseudo-ops":
</P>
<TABLE>
	<TR>
		<TD>.extern</TD>
		<TD>- external name reference;
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>.global</TD>
		<TD>- external name definition;
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>.align</TD>
		<TD>- force the program counter to a particular alignment;
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>.segment</TD>
		<TD>- start or resume a segment
	</TR>
</TABLE>        
<P>
The purpose of having the .segment directive is primarily to 
allow intermixing of values for different kinds of memories (such as 
code and data) in the same file. Each named segment has a unique base 
address, location counter increment, memory type, and word size. For 
instance, one segment might be a 64 bit microcode memory, while 
another might be a 16 bit byte-addressed data memory and another might 
be some sort of lookup table.
</P>
<P>
You can define up to 8 memory types. Normal applications may 
need to use only one (for code) or two (for code and data). The 
additional types are available for more complex applications involving 
extra, special-purpose memories. For instance, If you have a DSP
which has two data memories,
you can use a third memory type to support the second data memory.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="mclib">The Object Librarian - MCLIB</A></H3>

<P>
MCLIB can combine relocatable object modules into a 
relocatable object library, add modules to an existing library, delete 
modules from an existing library or reorder modules in a library. You 
can also use it to get information about the contents of a library, 
including:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>what modules are in a library</LI>
	<LI>what symbols and segments are defined in a module</LI>
	<LI>where a symbol is defined</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Because a library is simply one or more relocatable object 
modules concatenated together, you can use MCLIB to inspect any object 
module produced by MCASR.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="mclink">The Linker - MCLINK</A></H3>

<P>
MCLINK combines the relocatable load 
modules produced by MCASR into one or more absolute load modules, 
depending on the output format.

Any relocatable object file can be either loaded directly or 
treated as a library. If it is treated as a library, then each object 
module in the file is loaded only if some symbol which it defines is 
referred to by a previously loaded object file.
</P>
<P>
MCLINK can relocate addresses up to 32 bits 
wide. MCASR and MCLINK support the obvious basic relocation types. 
MCLINK can optionally generate a symbol file which contains the start 
address, end address, and memory type of each segment and the start 
address of each external symbol.
</P>
<P>
MCLINK supports several different output file formats:
<i>standard</i>, <i>image</i>, <i>absolute</i>
Common Object File Format (<i>COFF</i>),
and Extensible Linker Format (<i>ELF</i>).
The absolute file format can include assembler level debug information
(label tables and line number tables).
The COFF format can include either assembler level or compiler level
symbolic debug information.
The ELF format, which is used by most modern Unix implementations,
has the additional advantage over COFF in that its output files
are platform independent; for instance, and ELF file can be created
on an Intel machine and read on a SPARC machine, or vice versa.
Debbuging information in ELF format
files uses COFF format symbol tables
and line number tables.
For image format, MCLINK creates one 
file for each memory type which it finds. Each file is a binary image 
of data to be loaded into memory. For standard format, MCLINK 
generates one output file which contains a sequence of absolute 
records, each of which includes a header which identifies the memory 
type and load address of the record. We provide source code for 
programs to read both formats, so that you can modify whichever is 
appropriate to create your own custom downloading program or to 
reformat the output files for your own particular needs.
For COFF, ELF, and absolute formats, MCLINK creates a single output file
which contains code, data, and optional debugging information.
</P>
<P>
For each output format, we also provide source code for
a program which can read that output format.
You can use the source code as a basis for building a program
which will load an absolute load module,
produced by our linker, into your target hardware or software simulator.
The program which reads the COFF output format will
also display the contents of the debug symbol tables, if present.

<P>
You can order the tool set either with or without the compiler.
The version without the compiler omits the compiler, the peephole
optimizer, sample compiler control files,
C runtime source files,
and some programs which you can use to exercise the compiler
by compiling and running code for a demonstration architecture.
</P>
<P>
</P>
The DOS versions of the tools run as DOS command line programs.
They work properly in DOS Windows under Microsoft Windows 3.1
and Microsoft Windows 95 (but not Windows NT).
The WIN32 versions run as ``WIN32 Console Mode Apps''
under Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT.
<P>
